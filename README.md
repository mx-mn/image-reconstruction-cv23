# TODOs
- [ ] brainstorm for pipelines
- [Â ] find good focal length.



# Pipeline Ideas:

## General Stuff:
List of different methods for machine learning denoising: https://towardsai.net/p/deep-learning/image-de-noising-using-deep-learning

## Denoising Autoencoder
take 'noisy'/ occluded image with trees, use AE or VAE to denoise the image https://towardsdatascience.com/denoising-autoencoders-explained-dbb82467fc2
So we only use a single integral image, with a focal length that is good. Or we take a focal stack, and use the max pixel of each image. The result should be okayish.

(+) cheap and fast to train. Good literature  
(-) coarse, loss of information throug using only one focal length, or through averaging/argmaxing

## DEEEEEEP Learning
Take a stack of integral images with different focal stack. Use CNN or VIT. The different focal lengths are just like different color channels. 

(+) more information to use for learning  
(-) bigger network, more training, more compute, more time

# Focal Stack
Just some notes.
The focal point can be arbitrarily selected ? 
Where could a person be?
It could be form 0-300cm 
Most likely in a continous block (if it is not a ghost) e.g.: from 0-170cm or from 0-40cm if the person is laying down or 0-110cm if the person is sitting

How can we match the focal length to these values?
